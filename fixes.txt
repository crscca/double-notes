If you wish to allocate more resources for your builds or deployments, 
you can do that by increasing the limit. For deployments, you can use 
the web interface -> 'Action' menu -> 'Edit Resource Limits'. For builds, 
the same menu is not available, but you can use the 'Edit YAML' item and 
specify the limit manually, by adding something like this under the 'spec' 
section in the respective build config:

resources:
  limits:
    memory: 1Gi
